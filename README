Automation for standing up GKE clusters for 2020 HOT days

run the container as follows:
 docker run -d -t --rm --name gkeautomation mvilliger/gkehotday-automation:0.1 && docker exec -it gkeautomation /bin/sh -c "[ -e /bin/bash ] && /bin/bash || /bin/sh"

Inside container, get auth'd to gcloud:
gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser

create clusters as follows:
./cluster-create-wrapper.sh <class-name> <number of clusters>

Clusters will be created in the format of classname and a sequential number

a Kubeconfig for each cluster will be generated in the build folder on the container. 

If you would like each user's bastion to only be able to login to the respective cluster, copy the cluster's kubeconfig to the bastion

If you would like the ability to easily switch between clusters via kubectl config use-context you can append all the kubeconfigs to one file
